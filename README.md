<h1>🚗 Car Price Prediction</h1>
<h3>📌 Overview</h3>
The Car Price Prediction project uses machine learning to estimate the selling price of a car based on its features such as year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, brand, and other attributes.
This project can help car sellers, buyers, and dealerships make more informed decisions by providing a data-driven price estimate.
